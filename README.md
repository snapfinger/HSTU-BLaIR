### HSTU-BLaIR: Lightweight Contrastive Text Embedding for Generative Recommender

Recent advances in recommender systems have underscored the complementary strengths of generative modeling and pretrained language models. We propose **HSTU-BLaIR**, a hybrid framework that augments the Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit (HSTU)-based generative recommender with BLaIR, a lightweight contrastive text embedding model. This integration enriches item representations with semantic signals from textual metadata while preserving HSTUâ€™s powerful sequence modeling capabilities.

We evaluate HSTU-BLaIR on two e-commerce datasets: three subsets from the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset and the Steam dataset. We compare its performance against both the original HSTU-based recommender and a variant augmented with embeddings from OpenAIâ€™s state-of-the-art \texttt{text-embedding-3-large} model. Despite the latter being trained on a substantially larger corpus with significantly more parameters, our lightweight BLaIR-enhanced approachâ€”pretrained on domain-specific dataâ€”achieves better performance in nearly all cases. Specifically, HSTU-BLaIR outperforms the OpenAI embedding-based variant on all but one metric, where it is marginally lower, and matches it on another. These findings highlight the effectiveness of contrastive text embeddings in compute-efficient recommendation settings.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install the required Python packages with ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.

**HSTU-BLaIR** is built on top of [the HSTU-based generative recommender (commit `ece916f`)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/generative-recommenders/tree/ece916f) and extends it with additional modules for integrating textual embeddings. It has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.9, CUDA 12.6, and a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

---

## ðŸ§ª Experiments

To reproduce the experiments from our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10545), follow these steps:

### 1. Download and preprocess the data

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/ && python3 preprocess_public_data.py
```

To use OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` embeddings instead of BLaIR, update the corresponding line in `preprocess_public_data.py` as follows:

```python
text_embedding_model = "blair"
```

to

```python
text_embedding_model = "openai"
```

Make sure you have correctly set up your OpenAI API credentials if you choose this option.


### 2. Run the model

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 main.py --gin_config_file=configs/amzn23_game/hstu-sampled-softmax-n512-blair.gin --master_port=12345
```

You can find other configuration files in the configs/ directory for different settings and domains.

## ðŸ“Š Results
**Evaluation metrics on Video Games, Office Products, and Musical Instruments of Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset and Steam dataset**  

With the provided `.gin` files, you should be able to reproduce the following evaluation results within a small margin of variability. Minor differences may arise due to inherent non-determinism in model initialization, data loading, and/or hardware-level operations.

Each cell shows absolute values (top row) and percentage improvements over HSTU / SASRec (bottom row). Best values per column are bolded. 

*HSTU-OpenAI (TE3L)* denotes the HSTU model augmented with text embeddings generated via OpenAIâ€™s `text-embedding-3-large` API.
